          <p>Friendships are a funny thing. In the past.... and I mean wayyy back in the early days of mankind, friends were used as a tool for survival.
          </p>
          <p> Friends were used as allies. At the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/10/history-of-friendship-evolution_n_4743572.html">most basic level</a>, they helped navigate the elements and surroundings, they helped imporve reproductive success and most importantly, helped you live longer!
          </p>
          <p> Nowadays we have a more structured society and new technology to help with the survival part. So if we've got that covered.... what's the point of having friends?
          </p>
          <p> Well let me tell you! Humans are social cretures. Friends provide security and support, a sense of belonging through connection based on similar values and interests. They provide meaningful exchanges both creatively and intelectually. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-emotional-footprint/201602/the-importance-friendship">In short: Friends are super important!</a>
